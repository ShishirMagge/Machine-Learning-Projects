# Diabetes Prediction
 This is my first repository in the GitHub. Let's see how it goes.

The target of this project is to predict if a woman is diabetic or not based on her health report.
The input data is in the form of .csv file.


Since the problem has a binary output e.i, they can either be diabetic or not, we are going to use a classification form of supervised learning.
In this program, I have used KNearestNeighbors algorithm.

Keeping random_state=1 for the most accurate output, 
the accuracy came out to be around 88%.
